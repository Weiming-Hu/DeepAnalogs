## Overview

Training a deep network for weather analogs! This method was developed to identify weather analogs with a Machine Learning similarity metric.

The [Parallel Analog Ensemble](https://weiming-hu.github.io/AnalogsEnsemble/) is an implementation that uses the [original statistical metric](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/141/10/mwr-d-12-00281.1.xml) proposed by Dr. Delle Monache. However, the Deep Analogs seek to use a deep network for weather analog identification.
