## Overview

Training a deep network for weather analogs! This method was developed to identify weather analogs with a Machine Learning similarity metric.

The [Parallel Analog Ensemble](https://weiming-hu.github.io/AnalogsEnsemble/) is an implementation that uses the [original statistical metric](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/mwre/141/10/mwr-d-12-00281.1.xml) proposed by Dr. Delle Monache. However, the Deep Analogs seek to use a deep network for weather analog identification.

This code has been used in the paper [Weather Analogs with a Machine Learning Similarity Metric for Renewable Resource Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.04530).

## Installation

```
pip install git+git://github.com/Weiming-Hu/DeepAnalogs.git
```

## Usage

```
deep_analogs_train -h
```

Currently, this package is still under active development. So please use it at your own discretion. But I'm also happy to answer any questions or provide help.
